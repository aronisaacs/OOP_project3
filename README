1. According to the UML, briefly explain each classes' responsibility in the program.
//The main thing you should understand is the shell state and the shell commands classes. they all implement
the command interface, which has a single method called execute(). Other than that I didn't add many new
classes beyond what you know of

2. For every Java data structure you used, explain why you chose it and how you used it. Take into account
time and space complexity.
//As far as I know we only used map and set in your part of the code. I also used the TreeSet in the shell state
in order to save the current characters.

3. Explain how you used the exception handling mechanism in your program to take care of user input errors
and how you printed them.
//All errors are handled in the relevant classes, then they get bubbled up to the command class and from there
to the run() method in the shell class. There is an additional ShellException class that is just used
to indicate errors that are specific to the shell.

4. If you made changes to the SubImgCharMatcher class, explain what you changed and why.
//make sure to write about getCharSet() function in the SubImgCharMatcher file - it is used by the shell state
to get the characters in use

5. If you made changes to the classes that were given to us, explain what you changed and why. (Obviously, no
changes can be made to anything in ascii_output package, but other classes can be changed if needed)
//I believe we did not make any changes but you should take a look at the provided code from the moodle and
ensure we didnt change anything in those classes.
